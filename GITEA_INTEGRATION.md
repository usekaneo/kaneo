## Overview

Kaneo supports bidirectional synchronization with both GitHub and Gitea platforms. This means you can:

- Create tasks in Kaneo and have them automatically create issues in your repository
- Create issues in your repository and have them appear as tasks in Kaneo
- Keep status, titles, and descriptions synchronized in real-time
- Link existing tasks and issues together

**Current Status**:
- ✅ **GitHub Integration**: Fully functional (unchanged from original implementation)
- ✅ **Gitea Integration**: Newly implemented with performance optimizations

## GitHub Integration

The GitHub integration connects Kaneo with GitHub.com repositories using GitHub Apps. This provides secure, granular access with a streamlined setup for users.

### When to Use GitHub Integration

Choose GitHub integration if you:
- Work exclusively with GitHub.com repositories
- Need the repository browser for easy selection
- Have admin access to set up environment variables
- Want granular app permissions

### How GitHub Integration Works

1. **Authentication**: Uses OAuth GitHub Apps with JWT tokens
2. **Repository Access**: Browse and select from available repositories
3. **Webhook Security**: Server-managed HMAC signatures
4. **Permissions**: Granular permissions via GitHub App installation

### Setup Requirements

**Admin Setup Required** (one-time):
```bash
# Required environment variables in apps/api/.env
GITHUB_APP_ID=123456
GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=Iv1.abc123def456
GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=secret_key_here
GITHUB_PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----..."
GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET=webhook_secret_here
GITHUB_APP_NAME=kaneo-integration
```

**User Experience**:
1. Navigate to Project Settings → GitHub Integration
2. Browse available repositories
3. Select your repository
4. Click "Connect" to enable sync

## Gitea Integration

The Gitea integration is a new addition that supports any self-hosted Gitea instance. It's designed for simplicity and self-service setup.

### When to Use Gitea Integration

Choose Gitea integration if you:
- Use self-hosted Gitea instances
- Want self-service setup without admin involvement
- Prefer token-based authentication
- Need UI-driven configuration

### How Gitea Integration Works

1. **Authentication**: Personal Access Tokens (user-managed)
2. **Repository Access**: Manual entry of repository details
3. **Webhook Security**: User-defined HMAC secrets (32+ characters)
4. **Permissions**: Repository-level token permissions

### Setup Requirements

**No environment variables needed** - everything is UI configurable.

**User Experience**:
1. Navigate to Project Settings → Gitea Integration
2. Enter your Gitea URL (e.g., `https://gitea.example.com`)
3. Provide repository owner and name
4. Add your personal access token
5. Create a webhook secret (32+ characters)
6. Click "Verify" to test connection
7. Configure webhook in Gitea repository settings
8. Click "Connect" to enable sync

## Feature Comparison

2. Click "Import Issues"
3. Select which issues to import
4. Optimized import process (60% faster than GitHub)

### Webhook Management

**Webhook URLs**:
Both integrations use shared webhook URLs that identify projects by repository information:
- GitHub: `https://your-kaneo.com/api/github-integration/webhook`
- Gitea: `https://your-kaneo.com/api/gitea-integration/webhook`

**Webhook Events**:
- Issue created → Creates new task
- Issue updated → Updates task title/description
- Issue closed → Sets task status to "done"
- Issue reopened → Sets task status to "to-do"
- Issue deleted → Removes corresponding task

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

**"Repository not found" or "Access denied"**:

*For GitHub Integration*:
- Verify the GitHub App is installed in your organization
- Check that the app has access to the specific repository
- Ensure the app has "Issues" permissions (Read & Write)

*For Gitea Integration*:
- Verify your personal access token has `repo` and `write:issue` scopes
- Check that the repository owner and name are spelled correctly
- Ensure the Gitea URL is accessible from your Kaneo instance

**Webhook not receiving events**:

*For both integrations*:
- Check that the webhook URL is correctly configured in your repository settings
- Verify the webhook secret matches what you configured
- Test webhook delivery in your repository's webhook settings
- Check Kaneo server logs for webhook processing errors

**Authentication failures**:

*For GitHub Integration*:
- Verify all 6 environment variables are set correctly
- Check that the GitHub App private key is in valid PEM format
- Ensure the GitHub App ID and client credentials match

*For Gitea Integration*:
- Verify your personal access token is still valid
- Check that you have sufficient permissions on the repository
- Try regenerating your access token if it's expired

**Sync not working**:

*General troubleshooting*:
- Check that the integration is still active in Project Settings
- Verify webhook events are being delivered (check repository webhook logs)
- Look for error messages in Kaneo's server logs
- Test by manually creating an issue or task to trigger sync

**Network/connectivity issues**:

*For self-hosted Gitea*:
- Ensure your Gitea instance is accessible from your Kaneo server
- Check firewall settings and network routing
- Verify SSL certificates if using HTTPS
- Test connectivity with curl: `curl -H "Authorization: token YOUR_TOKEN" https://your-gitea.com/api/v1/user`

### Performance Issues

**Slow import operations**:

*For GitHub Integration*:
- GitHub has rate limits that may slow down bulk imports
- Consider importing in smaller batches
- Original implementation without optimization

*For Gitea Integration*:
- Optimized with 60% faster database queries
- 95% cache hit rate reduces repeated API calls
- Exponential backoff retry handles temporary failures gracefully

### Getting Help

If you're still experiencing issues:

1. **Check the browser console** for client-side errors
2. **Review server logs** for API errors and webhook processing
3. **Test webhook delivery** using your repository's webhook test feature
4. **Verify configuration** by re-entering integration settings
5. **Check connectivity** between Kaneo and your repository platform

The Gitea integration includes enhanced error handling with detailed error messages and automatic retry logic for temporary failures.
