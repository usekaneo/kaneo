## Introduction

Kaneo <span className='text-fd-muted-foreground text-sm'>(/kəˈneɪ.oʊ/)</span> is a project management tool that gets out of your way. It is designed to be a simple, yet powerful tool for managing your projects. It **works for you** instead of you working for it.

### Components

Kaneo is composed of several components:

- API: The backend API that powers the application, it is built with Hono and TypeScript.
- Web: The frontend web application that is built with React and Tailwind CSS.
- Database: The database that is built with PostgreSQL.

### Installation

We offer two ways to install Kaneo:

**Quick Setup with drim (Recommended)**

For straightforward deployments, use [drim](/core/installation/drim) - a CLI tool that handles everything automatically:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://assets.kaneo.app/install.sh | sh
drim setup
```

**Manual Setup with Docker Compose**

For more control or complex setups, follow the manual installation process:

- [Setting up the Docker compose file](/core/installation/docker-compose)
- [Setting up the environment variables](/core/installation/environment-variables)
- [Starting the services](/core/installation/start-services)
