## Railway Template

Kaneo provides an official Railway template for easy deployment with a single click.

<DeployButton href="https://railway.com/deploy/kaneo">
  Deploy on Railway
</DeployButton>

## What the Template Includes

The Railway template automatically configures:

- **PostgreSQL Database**: Managed PostgreSQL instance
- **API Service**: Pre-configured Hono API server
- **Web Service**: Pre-configured React web application
- **Environment Variables**: All required variables with sensible defaults
- **Networking**: Proper service discovery and internal communication
- **Build Configuration**: Optimized Docker builds for both services

## Deployment Steps

1. **Click the Deploy Button** above to open the Railway template
2. **Connect to Railway** (sign up or log in if needed)
3. **Configure Environment Variables**:
   - Set your `AUTH_SECRET` (minimum 32 characters)
   - Review other environment variables as needed
4. **Deploy** - Railway will build and deploy all services automatically

## Post-Deployment Setup

After deployment completes:

1. **Access Your Application**: Railway will provide URLs for both services
2. **Create Admin Account**: Visit the web application to create your first user
3. **Configure Domain** (optional): Add custom domains in Railway dashboard
4. **Set Up SSO** (optional): Configure GitHub, Google, or other providers

## Environment Variables

The template includes these pre-configured variables:

```
# Railway automatically sets these
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:password@host:port/database
KANEO_API_URL=https://your-api.railway.app
KANEO_CLIENT_URL=https://your-web.railway.app

# You may want to customize these
AUTH_SECRET=your-32-character-secret-here
CORS_ORIGINS=https://your-web.railway.app
```

## Monitoring and Scaling

Railway provides built-in:

- **Health Checks**: Automatic service monitoring
- **Logs**: Centralized logging for all services
- **Metrics**: Performance and usage analytics
- **Scaling**: Easy horizontal scaling when needed

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. **Check Logs**: Use Railway's log viewer to debug
2. **Verify Environment**: Ensure all required variables are set
3. **Redeploy**: Sometimes a fresh deployment resolves issues
4. **Check Resource Usage**: Free tier has limitations
