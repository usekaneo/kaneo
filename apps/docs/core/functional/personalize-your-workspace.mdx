Kaneo includes account and workspace preferences that improve clarity without adding noise.

## Open preferences

1. Go to **Settings**.
2. Open **Account -> Preferences**.

## Configure appearance defaults

Set the defaults your team prefers:

- Theme (light/dark)
- Default task view (board/list)
- Compact mode
- Sidebar default open/closed

## Configure task display options

Toggle the fields you want visible in views:

- Task numbers
- Assignees
- Due dates
- Labels
- Priority indicators

If needed, use **Reset** in preferences to return to defaults.

## Tune workspace and project settings

Also review:

- **Settings -> Workspace** for workspace-level details
- **Settings -> Projects** for project general, visibility, integrations, and workflow

## Suggested baseline for most teams

- Default view: Board
- Compact mode: Off initially
- Show assignees, due dates, labels, and priority: On

Adjust once your team has 1-2 weeks of active usage.
