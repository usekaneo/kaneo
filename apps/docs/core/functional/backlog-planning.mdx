title: Plan Work in Backlog
description: Use the backlog to prepare work before it enters active execution
---

Backlog view is your planning layer. Use it to prepare tasks before moving them into active columns.

## When to use Backlog

Use backlog when you need to:

- Break down upcoming scope
- Prioritize before execution
- Triage ambiguous requests
- Keep active columns focused on in-flight work

## Core workflow

1. Open your project **Backlog** view.
2. Add or edit planned tasks.
3. Apply priority, due date, labels, and assignee.
4. Filter by priority/assignee/due date/labels to review specific slices.
5. Move ready tasks from planning into active execution.

## Recommended planning cadence

- Daily: quick triage for new incoming work
- Weekly: backlog grooming and priority cleanup
- Sprint/start-of-cycle: move only ready tasks into active columns

## Quality checklist for ready tasks

A task is ready to move when it has:

- Clear title and expected outcome
- Owner assigned
- Priority set
- Necessary labels
- Due date (if time-sensitive)
