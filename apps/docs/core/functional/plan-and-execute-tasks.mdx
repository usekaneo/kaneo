title: Plan and Execute Tasks in Board and List
description: Create tasks, set metadata, and execute work using Board and List views
---

Use this workflow to move from planning to execution with minimal overhead.

## 1. Create tasks quickly

In a project:

1. Open **Board** or **List** view.
2. Click **Create task**.
3. Add a short, action-oriented title.
4. Optionally set description, assignee, priority, due date, and labels.

## 2. Keep task data clean

When editing tasks, prioritize:

- Clear scope in the description
- One owner (assignee)
- Explicit priority
- Realistic due dates
- Reusable labels

## 3. Execute in Board view

Board view is best for flow-based execution:

1. Pull tasks into active columns.
2. Drag tasks across columns as status changes.
3. Open a task to edit details without losing board context.

## 4. Switch to List view for dense review

List view is useful when you need to scan many tasks quickly.

Typical uses:

- Reviewing priorities across the project
- Spotting overdue work
- Finding unassigned or under-specified tasks

## 5. Use filters to focus

The board toolbar supports filtering by:

- Status
- Priority
- Assignee
- Due date
- Labels

Use filters aggressively during standups, planning, and triage.

## 6. Open full task page when needed

From the task sheet, use **Open in full page** for deeper edits and focused context.
