title: Create a Workspace and Project
description: Set up your first workspace and project structure in Kaneo
---

This guide covers the first functional setup inside Kaneo so your team can begin tracking work immediately.

## 1. Create a workspace

1. Go to the dashboard and create a new workspace.
2. Choose a clear workspace name (usually company, team, or department).
3. Confirm creation and open the workspace.

## 2. Create your first project

Inside the workspace Projects page:

1. Click **Create project**.
2. Set a project name your team will recognize quickly.
3. Open the project when it appears in the projects list.

## 3. Decide your execution view

Each project supports:

- **Board view** for status-driven execution
- **List view** for compact scanning and sorting
- **Backlog view** for planning and grooming

You can switch views as your workflow changes.

## 4. Define basic conventions before inviting others

Before team onboarding, align on:

- Default status flow (e.g. To Do -> In Progress -> Done)
- Priority usage (low/medium/high/urgent)
- Label naming style (feature, bug, area, etc.)
- Due date expectations

This keeps your board consistent from day one.
