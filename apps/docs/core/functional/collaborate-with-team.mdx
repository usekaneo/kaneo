description: Invite members, assign ownership, and keep team execution aligned
---

Good collaboration in Kaneo comes from clear ownership and consistent project conventions.

## 1. Invite members

In your workspace:

1. Open **Members**.
2. Click **Invite member**.
3. Send invitations to teammates.
4. Track active and pending members in the members table.

## 2. Assign clear ownership

For each active task:

- Assign one primary owner
- Use due dates for time-sensitive work
- Set priority to support tradeoff decisions

## 3. Standardize labels

Use labels to create a shared language across the team.

Examples:

- Work type: `bug`, `feature`, `chore`
- Domain: `api`, `web`, `infra`
- Risk/impact: `critical`, `customer-impact`

## 4. Use views intentionally

- **Board** for daily execution
- **List** for compact review and cleanup
- **Backlog** for planning and grooming

Switch views depending on the meeting or decision you are making.

## 5. Keep communication in the task

When scope, ownership, or timing changes, update the task directly so project history remains visible.
