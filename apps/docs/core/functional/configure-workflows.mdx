description: Customize columns and automation rules for how your project moves

Use workflow settings to match Kaneo to your team's delivery process.

## Open workflow settings

1. Go to **Settings**.
2. Open **Projects**.
3. Select a project.
4. Open the **Workflow** tab.

## Configure columns

In **Workflow -> Columns**:

1. Add or rename columns to reflect your real stages.
2. Reorder columns to match execution order.
3. Mark final columns as done states where appropriate.

Common examples:

- `To Do -> In Progress -> Review -> Done`
- `Backlog -> Ready -> In Progress -> QA -> Done`

## Configure automation rules

In **Workflow -> Automation Rules**:

1. Map integration events to target columns.
2. Verify each event moves work to the expected stage.

This helps keep project state aligned with external systems.

## Rollout strategy

When changing workflows on active projects:

- Announce the new column model first
- Migrate existing tasks in a single pass
- Keep naming stable after rollout

Frequent column churn reduces reporting clarity.
