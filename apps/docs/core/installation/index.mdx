## Choose Your Installation Method

Kaneo offers two installation methods depending on your needs:

### Quick Setup with drim (Recommended)

[drim](/core/installation/drim) is a CLI tool designed for straightforward Kaneo deployments. It's perfect for:

- Getting started quickly with minimal configuration
- Local development environments
- Simple production deployments with a single domain
- Automatic HTTPS setup

```bash
curl -fsSL https://assets.kaneo.app/install.sh | sh
drim setup
```

### Manual Setup with Docker Compose

For more control over your deployment or complex setups, use the manual installation process:

1. [Create the Docker Compose file](/core/installation/docker-compose)
2. [Configure environment variables](/core/installation/environment-variables)
3. [Start the services](/core/installation/start-services)

This method is ideal for:
- Custom networking configurations
- Multiple domains or complex reverse proxy setups
- Integration with existing infrastructure
- Advanced customization needs

## Requirements

Both methods require:

- Docker 20.10+
- Docker Compose V2
- 2GB RAM minimum
- 10GB disk space

**Supported Platforms:** Linux, macOS, Windows (WSL)
