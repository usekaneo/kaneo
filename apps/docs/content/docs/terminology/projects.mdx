## What are Projects?

Projects in Kaneo are collections of related tasks within a workspace. They help you organize your work into logical groups. A project could represent a product, a client, a department, or any other way you want to organize your tasks.

## Creating a Project

To create a new project:

1. Navigate to the workspace where you want to create the project
2. Click on "Projects" in the sidebar
3. Click the "New Project" button
4. Enter a name and optional description for your project
5. Click "Create"

## Project Views

Each project in Kaneo can be viewed in different ways:

- **List View**: Displays tasks in a simple list format
- **Board View**: Shows tasks organized by status in a Kanban-style board

To switch between views, use the view selector in the project header.

## Project Settings

To access project settings:

1. Navigate to the project
2. Click on the "Settings" button in the project header

From the settings page, you can:
- Update the project name and description
- Manage project members
- Configure project-specific settings

## Archiving and Deleting Projects

When a project is completed or no longer needed, you can:

- **Archive**: Keeps the project data but removes it from the active projects list
- **Delete**: Permanently removes the project and all its tasks

To archive or delete a project, go to the project settings and scroll to the bottom of the page.
