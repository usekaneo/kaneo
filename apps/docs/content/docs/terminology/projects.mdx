## What are Projects?

## Project Views

Each project in Kaneo can be viewed in different ways:

- **List View**: Displays tasks in a simple list format
- **Board View**: Shows tasks organized by status in a Kanban-style board

To switch between views, use the view selector in the project header.

<Step>
Navigate to the project
</Step>
<Step>

## Archiving and Deleting Projects

When a project is completed or no longer needed, you can:

- **Delete**: Permanently removes the project and all its tasks

To archive or delete a project, go to the project settings and scroll to the bottom of the page.
