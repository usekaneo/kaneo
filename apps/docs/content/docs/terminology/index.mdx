description: Understanding the key concepts in Kaneo
---

Kaneo is built around a few core concepts that help you organize and manage your work effectively. This guide provides an overview of these concepts and how they relate to each other.

## Core Entities

Kaneo organizes your work using the following key entities:

- **[Workspaces](/docs/concepts/workspaces)**: The top-level organizational unit that contains projects and team members
- **[Projects](/docs/concepts/projects)**: Collections of related tasks within a workspace
- **[Tasks](/docs/concepts/tasks)**: Individual work items that need to be completed
- **[Teams](/docs/concepts/teams)**: Groups of users who collaborate on workspaces and projects

Understanding how these entities work together will help you get the most out of Kaneo.

## Basic Workflow

A typical workflow in Kaneo looks like this:

1. Create a workspace
2. Invite team members to the workspace
3. Create projects within the workspace
4. Add tasks to your projects
5. Assign tasks to team members
6. Track progress as tasks move through your workflow

Each of these steps is explained in detail in the corresponding concept pages.
