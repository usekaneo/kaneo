Kaneo is built around a few core concepts that help you organize and manage your work effectively. This guide provides an overview of these concepts and how they relate to each other.

## Core Entities

Kaneo organizes your work using the following key entities:

- **[Workspaces](/docs/concepts/workspaces)**: The top-level organizational unit that contains projects and team members
- **[Projects](/docs/concepts/projects)**: Collections of related tasks within a workspace
- **[Tasks](/docs/concepts/tasks)**: Individual work items that need to be completed
- **[Teams](/docs/concepts/teams)**: Groups of users who collaborate on workspaces and projects

Understanding how these entities work together will help you get the most out of Kaneo.
