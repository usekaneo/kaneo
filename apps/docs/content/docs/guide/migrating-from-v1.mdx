title: Migrating from v1
description: This guide will help you migrate your Kaneo instance from v1 to v2.

## Overview

Migrating from v1 to v2 is a straightforward process. We have updated the environment variables and the compose file to use the new variables.

> **Note:** Please backup your database before migrating.

## Environment variables

The environment variables are used to configure the application. 

The big change is that we are using a `.env` file to store the variables.

1. Create a `.env` file in the root of the project.
2. JWT_ACCESS has been changed to AUTH_SECRET.

Other than that, there's newly introduced environment variables that you need to set.


- `KANEO_CLIENT_URL` (required)
- `AUTH_SECRET` (required)
- `DATABASE_URL` (required)
- `POSTGRES_DB` (required)
- `POSTGRES_USER` (required)
- `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` (required)
- `CORS_ORIGINS` (optional)
- `SMTP_HOST` (optional)
- `SMTP_PORT` (optional)
- `SMTP_SECURE` (optional)
- `SMTP_USER` (optional)
- `SMTP_PASSWORD` (optional)
- `SMTP_FROM` (optional)

For more information, see the [Environment variables](/docs/installation/environment-variables) page.

## Compose file

The compose file has been updated to use the new environment variables.

```yml
services:
  api:
    image: ghcr.io/usekaneo/api:latest
    env_file:
      - .env
      ...

  web:
    image: ghcr.io/usekaneo/web:latest
    env_file:
      - .env
      ...
```

For the complete compose file, see the [Docker Compose](/docs/installation/docker-compose) page.
