## Introduction

Kaneo <span className='text-fd-muted-foreground text-sm'>(/kəˈneɪ.oʊ/)</span> is a project management tool that gets out of your way. It is designed to be a simple, yet powerful tool for managing your projects. It **works for you** instead of you working for it.

### Components

Kaneo is composed of several components:

- API: The backend API that powers the application, it is built with Hono and TypeScript.
- Web: The frontend web application that is built with React and Tailwind CSS.
- Database: The database that is built with PostgreSQL.
