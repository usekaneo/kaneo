## Docker Compose Installation

The easiest way to get started with Kaneo is using Docker Compose. This setup includes PostgreSQL for reliable data storage:

<Steps>
<Step>
**Create your Docker Compose configuration**

Create a `compose.yml` file with the following content:
</Step>

```yaml
services:
  postgres:
    image: postgres:16-alpine
    environment:
      POSTGRES_DB: kaneo
      POSTGRES_USER: kaneo_user
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: kaneo_password
    volumes:
      - postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
    restart: unless-stopped

  backend:
    image: ghcr.io/usekaneo/api:latest
    environment:
      JWT_ACCESS: "your_secure_jwt_token"
      DATABASE_URL: "postgresql://kaneo_user:kaneo_password@postgres:5432/kaneo"
    ports:
      - 1337:1337
    depends_on:
      - postgres
    restart: unless-stopped

  frontend:
    image: ghcr.io/usekaneo/web:latest
    environment:
      KANEO_API_URL: "http://localhost:1337"
    ports:
      - 5173:5173
    depends_on:
      - backend
    restart: unless-stopped

volumes:
  postgres_data:
```

<Step>
**Start the services**

Run the following command to start all services:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

This will download the images and start the containers in the background.
</Step>

<Step>
**Access your Kaneo instance**

Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) in your browser.
</Step>

<Step>
**Create your first project**

Create your first project and start managing your tasks! üéâ

You'll be able to:
- Create projects and organize tasks
- Assign team members and set priorities
- Track progress with kanban boards
- Collaborate with your team in real-time
</Step>

</Steps>

## Environment Variables Reference

| Variable | Description | Required | Default |
| -------- | ----------- | -------- | ------- |
| `KANEO_API_URL` | The URL where the API is accessible | Yes | - |
| `JWT_ACCESS` | Secret key for generating JWT tokens | Yes | - |
| `DATABASE_URL` | PostgreSQL connection string | Yes | - |
| `DISABLE_REGISTRATION` | Enable/disable new user registration | No | `false` |

## Database Setup

Kaneo uses PostgreSQL for reliable data storage with proper relational integrity. The Docker Compose setup above handles this automatically, but if you're running Kaneo outside of Docker, you'll need to:

### Manual PostgreSQL Setup

1. **Install PostgreSQL** (version 12 or higher)
   ```bash
   # Ubuntu/Debian
   sudo apt install postgresql postgresql-contrib

   # macOS with Homebrew
   brew install postgresql
   ```

2. **Create a database and user:**
   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE kaneo;
   CREATE USER kaneo_user WITH PASSWORD 'your_password';
   GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE kaneo TO kaneo_user;
   ```

3. **Set the DATABASE_URL environment variable:**
   ```bash
   export DATABASE_URL="postgresql://kaneo_user:your_password@localhost:5432/kaneo"
   ```

## Security Considerations

For production deployments, make sure to:

- **Change default passwords**: Use strong, unique passwords for JWT_ACCESS and database credentials
- **Use HTTPS**: Deploy behind a reverse proxy with SSL/TLS certificates
- **Regular backups**: Set up automated database backups
- **Update regularly**: Keep your Kaneo installation up to date

## Migration from SQLite

If you're upgrading from a previous version that used SQLite, you'll need to migrate your data to PostgreSQL. We recommend:

1. **Export your data** from the old SQLite database
2. **Set up PostgreSQL** using the new Docker Compose configuration
3. **Import your data** into the new PostgreSQL database

Contact us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/rU4tSyhXXU) if you need help with the migration process.
