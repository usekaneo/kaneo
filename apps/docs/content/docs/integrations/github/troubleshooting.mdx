This guide helps you diagnose and fix common issues with the GitHub integration.

## Common Issues

### "GitHub App not installed" Error

**Problem**: Verification shows the app isn't installed on the repository.

**Symptoms**:
- Red error message in Kaneo UI
- "Connect Repository" button remains disabled
- Repository doesn't appear in the browser modal

**Solutions**:
1. **Check Installation Scope**
   - Go to [GitHub App installations](https://github.com/settings/installations)
   - Verify your app is installed on the correct account/organization
   - Check if the target repository is included in the installation scope

2. **Reinstall with Broader Access**
   - Edit your app installation
   - Change from "Selected repositories" to "All repositories"
   - Or add the specific repository to the selected list

3. **Verify Repository Ownership**
   - Ensure you're entering the correct repository owner (username/organization)
   - Check that the repository name is spelled correctly
   - Verify the repository exists and you have access to it

<Callout type="tip">
Use the "Browse Repositories" feature in Kaneo to see which repositories your app can access.
</Callout>

### "Missing Permissions" Error

**Problem**: App is installed but lacks required permissions.

**Symptoms**:
- Orange warning in verification
- App appears in installations but can't create issues
- Missing permissions listed in the error message

**Solutions**:
1. **Update App Permissions**
   - Go to your [GitHub App settings](https://github.com/settings/developers)
   - Edit your app and check permissions:
     - **Issues**: Must have **Write** access (not just Read)
     - **Metadata**: Must have **Read** access
     - **Contents**: Must have **Read** access

2. **Update Installation**
   - After changing app permissions, you may need to update the installation
   - Go to [GitHub App installations](https://github.com/settings/installations)
   - Click "Configure" next to your app
   - Review and accept any permission changes

3. **Check Organization Permissions**
   - For organization repositories, ensure the organization allows the app
   - Organization owners may need to approve third-party apps

### "Repository not found" Error

**Problem**: Repository exists but isn't accessible to the app.

**Symptoms**:
- Repository not found in verification
- 404-style errors in logs
- Repository doesn't appear in browse modal

**Solutions**:
1. **Verify Repository Details**
   - Double-check the repository owner and name
   - Ensure there are no typos or extra spaces
   - Check that the repository is public or your app has access to private repos

2. **Check Private Repository Access**
   - Private repositories require explicit app installation
   - Ensure your GitHub App is installed on the repository owner's account
   - Verify the app has permission to access private repositories

3. **Organization Repository Issues**
   - Check if the organization has third-party app restrictions
   - Ensure the app is approved by organization owners
   - Verify the app is installed at the organization level, not just personal account

### Environment Variable Issues

**Problem**: Integration doesn't work after configuration.

**Symptoms**:
- No GitHub issues created when tasks are made
- Authentication errors in logs
- Integration appears configured but doesn't function

**Solutions**:
1. **Verify All Variables Are Set**
   ```bash
   # Check if environment variables are loaded
   echo $GITHUB_APP_ID
   echo $GITHUB_CLIENT_ID
   # etc.
   ```

2. **Check Private Key Format**
   - Ensure `GITHUB_PRIVATE_KEY` includes the full content with proper line breaks
   - The key should start with `-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----`
   - The key should end with `-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----`
   - Include all newlines and formatting from the `.pem` file

3. **Restart Backend Service**
   - Environment variable changes require a service restart
   - For Docker Compose: `docker compose restart backend`
   - For Kubernetes: `kubectl rollout restart deployment/kaneo-backend`

4. **Check Log Output**
   - Look for authentication errors on startup
   - Verify the GitHub App ID is recognized
   - Check for private key parsing errors

<Callout type="warning">
Make sure your private key doesn't have any extra characters or missing newlines.
</Callout>

## Webhook Issues

### Webhook Not Receiving Events

**Problem**: GitHub events aren't reaching Kaneo.

**Symptoms**:
- Webhook events listed in GitHub but no logs in Kaneo
- Webhook delivery failures in GitHub App settings

**Solutions**:
1. **Verify Webhook URL**
   - Ensure the URL is publicly accessible: `https://your-domain.com/github-integration/webhook`
   - Test accessibility from external tools like curl or online checkers
   - Verify your domain has proper DNS resolution

2. **Check HTTPS Configuration**
   - GitHub requires HTTPS for webhook endpoints
   - Ensure your SSL certificate is valid and not self-signed
   - Test your webhook endpoint with online SSL checkers

3. **Firewall and Network Issues**
   - Ensure GitHub's IP ranges can reach your server
   - Check if your hosting provider blocks incoming webhooks
   - Verify no authentication middleware is blocking the webhook endpoint

### Webhook Signature Verification Fails

**Problem**: Webhooks reach Kaneo but signature verification fails.

**Symptoms**:
- "Invalid signature" errors in logs
- Webhook events rejected with 400 status

**Solutions**:
1. **Verify Webhook Secret**
   - Ensure `GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET` matches exactly what you set in the GitHub App
   - Check for extra spaces or characters
   - The secret is case-sensitive

2. **Check Secret Configuration**
   - In GitHub App settings, verify the webhook secret is set
   - If you changed the secret, update the environment variable and restart
   - Generate a new secret if there are persistent issues

## Testing and Debugging

### Testing the Integration

Follow these steps to systematically test your integration:

1. **Verify Environment Variables**
   ```bash
   # Check that all required variables are set (don't print private key!)
   echo "App ID: $GITHUB_APP_ID"
   echo "Client ID: $GITHUB_CLIENT_ID"
   echo "Webhook Secret: [REDACTED]"
   echo "App Name: $GITHUB_APP_NAME"
   ```

2. **Test Repository Access**
   - Use the "Browse Repositories" feature in Kaneo
   - Verify your target repository appears in the list
   - Try connecting a test repository first

3. **Create a Test Task**
   - Create a simple task in your connected project
   - Check GitHub immediately for the new issue
   - Verify the issue format and labels are correct

4. **Check Backend Logs**
   Look for these log messages:
   ```
   ✅ GitHub issue created: { issueNumber: 42, issueUrl: "...", taskId: "...", repository: "..." }
   ❌ Failed to create GitHub issue: [error details]
   ✅ Task created: { taskId: "...", title: "...", projectId: "..." }
   ```

### Log Analysis

**Successful Integration Logs**:
```
Task created: { taskId: "task_123", title: "Fix bug", projectId: "proj_456" }
Creating GitHub issue for repository: owner/repo
GitHub issue created: { issueNumber: 42, issueUrl: "https://github.com/owner/repo/issues/42" }
```

**Common Error Patterns**:
```
❌ No active GitHub integration found for project: proj_456
❌ Failed to create GitHub issue: HttpError: Bad credentials
❌ Repository not found: owner/nonexistent-repo
❌ App installation not found for repository: owner/repo
```

### GitHub App Diagnostics

Use GitHub's built-in tools to diagnose issues:

1. **App Installation Page**
   - Visit [GitHub App installations](https://github.com/settings/installations)
   - Check which repositories your app can access
   - Review granted permissions

2. **Webhook Delivery Logs**
   - In your GitHub App settings, check the "Advanced" tab
   - Review recent webhook deliveries and their status codes
   - Look for failed deliveries or error responses

3. **Repository Integration Status**
   - Go to your repository's Settings → Integrations & services
   - Verify your app appears in the list
   - Check the app's permissions and access
