This guide walks you through creating and configuring a GitHub App to enable the Kaneo integration. **Start here before deploying or configuring your Kaneo instance.**

## Overview

A GitHub App provides secure, granular access to your repositories and allows Kaneo to:
- Create issues automatically when tasks are created
- Access repository metadata for verification
- Receive webhook events for issue synchronization

<Callout type="info">
GitHub Apps are more secure than personal access tokens and provide better permission control.
</Callout>

<Callout type="error">
**Important**: Complete this GitHub App setup **before** deploying Kaneo. You'll need the app credentials during deployment configuration.
</Callout>

## Step 1: Create a GitHub App

<Steps>
<Step>
**Navigate to GitHub App Settings**

Go to [GitHub Developer Settings](https://github.com/settings/developers) and click "New GitHub App".
</Step>

<Step>
**Configure Basic Information**

Fill in the basic app information:

- **GitHub App name**: `kaneo-[your-instance-name]` (must be unique across GitHub)
- **Description**: `Kaneo project management integration`
- **Homepage URL**: Your planned Kaneo instance URL (e.g., `https://kaneo.yourdomain.com`)
- **Webhook URL**: `https://your-kaneo-instance.com/github-integration/webhook`
- **Webhook secret**: Generate a secure random string (save this for later)

<Callout type="warning">
Replace `your-kaneo-instance.com` with your planned Kaneo domain. The webhook URL must be publicly accessible once deployed.
</Callout>
</Step>

<Step>
**Set Repository Permissions**

Configure the following permissions:

| Permission | Access | Purpose |
|------------|---------|---------|
| **Issues** | Read & Write | Create and update issues |
| **Metadata** | Read | Access repository information |
| **Contents** | Read | Access repository metadata |

<Callout type="error">
**Critical**: Make sure to grant **Write** access to Issues - this is required for creating issues automatically.
</Callout>
</Step>

<Step>
**Subscribe to Webhook Events**

**This step is required for proper integration.** Subscribe to these events:

- **Issues** - To track when issues are created, updated, or closed
- **Issue Comments** - To track comments on issues

<Callout type="error">
**Required**: You must subscribe to **Issues** events for the integration to work properly. This enables bidirectional synchronization between Kaneo tasks and GitHub issues.
</Callout>

<Callout type="info">
These webhook events enable real-time synchronization between your Kaneo tasks and GitHub issues.
</Callout>
</Step>

<Step>
**Create the App**

Click "Create GitHub App" to create your app. You'll be redirected to the app settings page.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Step 2: Generate Credentials

<Steps>
<Step>
**Generate and Download Private Key**

1. Scroll down to the "Private keys" section
2. Click "Generate a private key"
3. Download the `.pem` file - you'll need its contents for configuration

<Callout type="warn">
Keep this private key secure! It's used to authenticate your Kaneo instance with GitHub.
</Callout>
</Step>

<Step>
**Note Your App Information**

From the app settings page, note down these important values:

- **App ID** (shown at the top of the page)
- **Client ID** (in the "Basic information" section)
- **Client Secret** (click "Generate a new client secret")
- **Webhook Secret** (the one you created earlier)
- **Private Key** (contents of the downloaded `.pem` file)

<Callout type="info">
You'll need all of these values for the [configuration step](/docs/integrations/github/configuration).
</Callout>
</Step>
</Steps>

## Step 3: Install the App

<Steps>
<Step>
**Install on Your Account/Organization**

1. Go to your GitHub App settings page
2. Click "Install App" in the left sidebar
3. Choose your account or organization
4. Select repositories:
   - **All repositories** (if you want integration available for all repos)
   - **Selected repositories** (choose specific repos)

<Callout type="tip">
You can modify repository access later by going to your [GitHub App installations](https://github.com/settings/installations).
</Callout>
</Step>

<Step>
**Verify Installation**

After installation, you should see your app listed in:
- [Your GitHub App installations](https://github.com/settings/installations)
- The repository's Settings â†’ Integrations & services (for organization repos)
</Step>
</Steps>

## Security Best Practices

### App Configuration
- **Use descriptive names**: Make it clear the app is for Kaneo integration
- **Limit permissions**: Only grant the minimum required permissions
- **Repository scope**: Install only on repositories that need integration

### Credential Management
- **Secure storage**: Store credentials in environment variables or secret management systems
- **Regular rotation**: Generate new private keys periodically
- **Access control**: Limit who has access to the GitHub App settings

## Common Issues

### App Name Already Taken
If your desired app name is taken, try:
- Adding your organization name: `kaneo-mycompany`
- Adding a timestamp: `kaneo-mycompany-2024`
- Using a different naming convention: `mycompany-kaneo`

### Webhook URL Not Accessible
Ensure your Kaneo instance is:
- Publicly accessible on the internet
- Using HTTPS (GitHub requires this for webhooks)
- Not behind authentication that would block GitHub's webhook calls

### Permission Issues
Double-check that you've granted:
- **Write** access to Issues (not just Read)
- **Read** access to Metadata and Contents
- Selected the correct repositories during installation

## Next Steps

Now that your GitHub App is created and configured:

1. **[Deploy Kaneo](/docs/getting-started/deployment)** - Deploy your Kaneo instance with the GitHub App credentials
2. **[Configure GitHub Integration](/docs/integrations/github/configuration)** - Complete the integration setup in your deployed Kaneo instance
3. **[Connect Repositories](/docs/integrations/github/configuration#connecting-repositories)** - Link your projects to GitHub repositories

<Callout type="info">
**Important**: Have your GitHub App credentials ready before deployment. You'll need to set them as environment variables during the deployment process.
</Callout>
