All API endpoints require authentication using an API key. This guide explains how to create an API key and use it to authenticate your requests.

## Creating an API Key

<Steps>
<Step>
**Sign in to Kaneo**

Sign in to your Kaneo instance using your account credentials.
</Step>

<Step>
**Navigate to Settings**

Go to your account settings by clicking on your profile or navigating to the Settings page.
</Step>

<Step>
**Open the Account Tab**

In the Settings page, click on the **Account** tab to view your account settings.
</Step>

<Step>
**Access API Keys Section**

Scroll down to the **API Keys** section in the Account tab. This section is located under the Developer Settings.
</Step>

<Step>
**Create a New API Key**

Click the **Create API Key** button to generate a new API key. You'll be prompted to provide a name for your API key to help you identify it later.
</Step>

<Step>
**Save Your API Key**

After creating the API key, you'll be shown the full API key value. **Copy and save this key immediately** - it will not be shown again for security reasons.

<Callout type="error">
**Important**: Store your API key securely. If you lose it, you'll need to create a new one. The API key cannot be retrieved after creation.
</Callout>
</Step>
</Steps>

## Using Your API Key

Once you have your API key, include it in the `Authorization` header of all API requests using the Bearer token format:

```bash
Authorization: Bearer your-api-key-here
```

### Example Request

Here's an example of making an authenticated API request using curl:

```bash
curl -X GET https://your-kaneo-instance.com/api/task?workspaceId=your-workspace-id \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your-api-key-here" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

### Example with JavaScript

```javascript
const response = await fetch('https://your-kaneo-instance.com/api/task?workspaceId=your-workspace-id', {
  method: 'GET',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': 'Bearer your-api-key-here',
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  }
});
```

## Security Best Practices

- **Keep your API keys secret**: Never commit API keys to version control or share them publicly
- **Use descriptive names**: Name your API keys clearly so you can identify their purpose (e.g., "Production Script", "Development Testing")
- **Rotate keys regularly**: Periodically create new API keys and revoke old ones
- **Limit key scope**: Only grant API keys to trusted applications and services
- **Monitor usage**: Regularly review your API keys and remove any that are no longer needed

<Callout type="warning">
If you suspect your API key has been compromised, immediately revoke it in the API Keys section and create a new one.
</Callout>
