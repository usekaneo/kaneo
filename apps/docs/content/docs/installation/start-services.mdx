## Start the services

Congratulations! You have now set up the services to start using Kaneo. 

To start the services, you can use the following command:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

You can now access the web application at [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173).

The next logical step would be to set up a reverse proxy to access the web application from the internet.

- Nginx
- Traefik
