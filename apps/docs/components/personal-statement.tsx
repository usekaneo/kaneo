            I'm <strong className="text-foreground font-medium">Andrej</strong>,
            and I created Kaneo because I was tired of project management tools
            that got in the way more than they helped. After years of using
            bloated, overcomplicated platforms that{" "}
            <strong className="text-foreground font-medium">
              distracted from actual work
            </strong>
            , I knew there had to be a better way.

          <p>
            The problem wasn't that these tools lacked features—it was that they
            had{" "}
            <strong className="text-foreground font-medium">too many</strong>.
            Every notification, every unnecessary button, every complex workflow
            was pulling my team away from what mattered:{" "}
            <strong className="text-foreground font-medium">
              building great products
            </strong>
            .
          </p>

          <p>
            I believe the best tools are{" "}
            <strong className="text-foreground font-medium">invisible</strong>.
            They should amplify your team's natural workflow, not force you to
            adapt to theirs. Kaneo is built on the principle that{" "}
            <strong className="text-foreground font-medium">
              less is more
            </strong>
            —every feature exists because it solves a real problem, not because
            it looks impressive in a demo.
