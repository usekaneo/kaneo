Kaneo (`/kəˈneɪ.oʊ/`) is project management that stays out of your way.  
This docs site is built to get you from zero to a running instance fast, then help you operate it confidently.

## Where to Begin

- [Quick Start](/core/index) for the fastest path to a running instance
- [Installation Guide](/core/installation/index) to choose drim vs Docker Compose
- [GitHub Integration Setup](/core/integrations/github/setup) for repo sync
- [API Introduction](/api-reference/introduction) for authenticated API usage

## Why Kaneo Exists

Kaneo follows a simple idea: **all you need, nothing you don’t**.

I'm Andrej, and I created Kaneo because I was tired of project management tools that got in the way more than they helped. After years of using bloated, overcomplicated platforms that distracted from actual work, I knew there had to be a better way.

The problem wasn't that these tools lacked features—it was that they had too many. Every notification, every unnecessary button, every complex workflow was pulling my team away from what mattered: building great products.

I believe the best tools are invisible. They should amplify your team's natural workflow, not force you to adapt to theirs. Kaneo is built on the principle that less is more—every feature exists because it solves a real problem, not because it looks impressive in a demo.

## Planning in Kaneo

Planning in Kaneo is intentionally lightweight: you define the work, assign clear ownership, and move forward without ceremony.

Labels are central to that flow. Use labels to group initiatives, surface cross-cutting work, and keep prioritization clear across board and list views.

- Use labels to represent streams like `onboarding`, `backend`, or `customer-feedback`
- Combine labels with priority and due dates for sharper planning
- Keep label naming consistent across the workspace so filtering stays useful
