## Code of Conduct

We want everyone to feel welcome here. Please be respectful and follow our [Code of Conduct](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/0/code_of_conduct/).

## Getting Started

### What You'll Need

- **Node.js** (18 or newer)
- **pnpm** (we use this instead of npm/yarn)
- **Git**
- **Docker** (optional, for testing full deployments)

### Setting Up Your Dev Environment

1. **Fork and clone the repo**:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/kaneo.git
cd kaneo
```

2. **Install dependencies**:
```bash
pnpm install
```

3. **Set up environment variables**:
```bash
# Copy the sample environment files
cp apps/api/.env.sample apps/api/.env
cp apps/web/.env.sample apps/web/.env

# Update the environment variables as needed
# See ENVIRONMENT_SETUP.md for detailed instructions
```

4. **Start everything up**:
```bash
pnpm run dev
```

This starts both the API (port 1337) and web app (port 5173). Both will automatically reload when you make changes.

> **Tip**: The web app at http://localhost:5173 will automatically connect to the API at http://localhost:1337

> **Need help with setup?** See our [Environment Setup Guide](ENVIRONMENT_SETUP.md) for detailed instructions and troubleshooting tips.

## Making Your First Contribution

### Finding Something to Work On

- **Browse [open issues](https://github.com/usekaneo/kaneo/issues)** - look for "good first issue" labels
- **Check our [Discord](https://discord.gg/rU4tSyhXXU)** - we often discuss features and bugs there
- **Found a bug?** Feel free to fix it and open a PR

### The Process

1. **Create a branch** for your work:
```bash
git checkout -b fix/whatever-youre-fixing
# or
git checkout -b feat/cool-new-feature
```

2. **Make your changes** and test them locally

3. **Commit using conventional commits**:
```bash
git commit -m "fix: resolve calendar date selection bug"
git commit -m "feat: add bulk task operations"
git commit -m "docs: update deployment guide"
```

4. **Push and create a PR**:
```bash
git push origin your-branch-name
```

Then open a pull request on GitHub with a clear description of what you changed and why.

## Development Guidelines

### Code Style

We use **Biome** for formatting and linting. Before you commit:

```bash
pnpm run lint
pnpm run format
```

Most editors can auto-format on save if you install the Biome extension.

### Commit Messages

We use [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) to keep our history clean:

- `feat:` - New features
- `fix:` - Bug fixes
- `docs:` - Documentation changes
- `refactor:` - Code changes that don't add features or fix bugs
- `test:` - Adding or updating tests
- `chore:` - Maintenance tasks
