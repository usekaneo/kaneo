## What is drim?

[drim](https://github.com/usekaneo/drim) is a CLI tool for deploying your Kaneo instances. It's designed for fairly straightforward setups where you want to get Kaneo up and running quickly without manual configuration.

drim handles:
- Docker Compose file generation
- Environment variable setup
- Automatic HTTPS with Caddy
- Service management (start, stop, restart)
- Updates and upgrades

## Installation

Install drim with a single command:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://assets.kaneo.app/install.sh | sh
```

Or download the binary manually from [releases](https://github.com/usekaneo/drim/releases/latest).

## Quick Start

### Local Development

For local development without a domain:

```bash
drim setup
# Press Enter when prompted for domain
# Access at http://localhost
```

### Production Deployment

For production with automatic HTTPS:

```bash
drim setup
# Enter your domain when prompted (e.g., kaneo.example.com)
# Access at https://your-domain.com
```

<Info>
Make sure your domain's DNS A record points to your server before running setup.
</Info>

## Commands

drim provides several commands to manage your Kaneo instance:

```bash
drim setup        # Deploy Kaneo
drim start        # Start services
drim stop         # Stop services
drim restart      # Restart services
drim upgrade      # Update Kaneo to latest version
drim update       # Update drim CLI to latest version
drim configure    # Edit configuration
drim uninstall    # Remove Kaneo
```

## What Gets Installed

When you run `drim setup`, the following services are deployed:

- **PostgreSQL 16** - Database
- **Kaneo API** - Backend service
- **Kaneo Web** - Frontend interface
- **Caddy** - Reverse proxy with automatic HTTPS

All services run in Docker containers with proper networking and health checks.

## Configuration

To edit environment variables after setup:

```bash
drim configure
```

This opens `.env` in your default editor. After saving, services are restarted automatically.

See the [environment variables documentation](/core/installation/environment-variables) for available options.

## Requirements

- Docker 20.10+
- Docker Compose V2
- 2GB RAM minimum
- 10GB disk space

**Supported Platforms:** Linux, macOS, Windows (WSL)

<Info>
drim will attempt to install Docker automatically on supported Linux distributions.

## When to Use drim

drim is ideal for:

- Quick local development setups
- Simple production deployments with a single domain
- Teams that want automatic HTTPS without manual configuration
- Anyone who wants to get Kaneo running with minimal effort

For more complex setups (multiple domains, custom networking, Kubernetes, etc.), see the [manual Docker Compose installation](/core/installation/docker-compose).
